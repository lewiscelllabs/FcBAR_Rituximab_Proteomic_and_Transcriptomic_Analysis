FcBAR Proteomic and RNA-Seq Analysis
This repository contains the data and code to accompany "Improving Recombinant Antibody Production Using FcBAR: An In Situ Approach to Detect and Amplify Protein-Protein Interactions"(https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.06.12.659199v1) by Wu et al.

This Repository includes:
1. Proteomic analysis of the FcBAR proteomic dataset in R using the DEP package.
2. Transcriptomic analysis of the rituximab RNA-Seq dataset in R. 

Datasets:
The FcBar and RNA-Seq file used to perform the analysis is included in this repository.
